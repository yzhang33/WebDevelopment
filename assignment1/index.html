        <h2>Do not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</h2>
        <hr>
          <p> Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
            Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
            <br>
            Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
            Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
            <br>
            Good men, cum on it the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
            Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
            <br>
            Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
            And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
            <br>
            Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
            Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
            <br>
            And you, my father, there on that sad height,<br>
            Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<p>
